# CITKat - A Web Catalog for CITK

## Installation
```shell
$ ./setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/.local
``` 
will install CITKat into your home folder and adds `citkat` to your `$PATH` environment.

If your shell still cannot find the `citkat` command, you might have to adjust your `$PATH` like this:
```shell
$ export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```
Be sure to add the above line to your shell's config file as well in that case.

### Dependencies
Besides the pip-dependencies (which will be resolved automatically for you) you'll have to install `npm`. 
The best way is to use your distribution's package manager to install `npm` 

## Usage
navigate to your local working directory (containing the XML files, generated by the `build-generator`) using a 
terminal and shell of your choice, then execute `citkat`:
```shell
$ cd your/working/dir
$ citkat
```
CITKat will fire up a webserver; you can now preview your catalog data using your favorite browser.

## CITKat XML Schema Documentation
You may generate the schema documentation by using the following command:
```shell
$ git submodule init; git submodule update  # get xs3p from submodule
$ xsltproc -o schema/CITKat.xsd.html xs3p/xs3p.xsl schema/CITKat.xsd
```
